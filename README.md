# projectc
Website(s) for people to submit their contact details and hack ideas! You can find other students/ people near you who are working on 
similar things, or you can put out your own idea for interested people to work with you. 
To be added:
CSS to make things look better
Must add more fields to database+form entry( right now only 2-3 for simplicity)
Adding tags for people to look up projects based on technical abilities/prereqs
